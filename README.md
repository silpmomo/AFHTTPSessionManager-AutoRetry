AFNetworking AutoRetry
## Installation with CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like AFNetworking in your projects. See the ["Getting Started" guide for more information](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/wiki/Getting-Started-with-AFNetworking). You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate AFNetworking-AutoRetry into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

    pod 'AFNetworking+AutoRetry'

Then, run the following command:

    pod install
